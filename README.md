# Efficient AI - Courses

These courses aim to provide knowledge and skills to build, compress, evaluate and deploy efficient AI models. It starts with the basics of AI and ends with advanced topics. It is composed of lectures and hands-on exercises (which can be run on a local machine or on a remote machine). It is designed for students, engineers, and researchers who want to learn about efficient AI. It is under active development. If you find it helpful, please ⭐ star this repository!

## Lectures
The [lectures](https://ln5.sync.com/dl/7d21bc370/gxpiqj2b-4k22jgex-x8i7zgxr-9pkajy52) contains lecture slides to give the knowledge on efficient architectures, compression, and evaluation for AI models. You can find the following topics:
- Architectures for LLMs
- Evaluation for LLMs
- Compression for LLMs
- Quantization for LLMs
- Finetuning for LLMs

**References:** The lecture content is based on multiple sources (incl. papers, books, and lectures). You can find the main sources in the [Awesome AI efficiency](https://github.com/PrunaAI/awesome-ai-efficiency) repository. If you find it helpful, please ⭐ star the [Awesome AI efficiency](https://github.com/PrunaAI/awesome-ai-efficiency) repository!

## Exercises
The folders `exercises` and `solutions` contains hands-on coding exercises and solutions for efficient architectures, compression, and evaluation for AI models. You can find the following exercises:
- Analyze LLM architectures
- Measure LLM efficiency
- Benchmark LLM quantization methods
- Benchmark LLM quantization bits
- Compile LLM
- Use data during LLM quantization
- Finetune (Compressed) LLM
- Search optimal LLM compression

**Requirements:** 
- While it can work with large models and powerful CPU/GPU hardware (e.g. V100, A100), exercises are designed to also support small models, and modest CPU/GPU hardware (e.g. 1080, 2080) for better accessibility.
- You can easily setup coding environment by running `bash setup_exercises.sh`. It is also recommended to login with your `HF_TOKEN` and define the Hugging Face cache directory to download models from Hugging Face. In particular, most exercises are based on the `pruna` package for productive exploration of efficient AI topics. If you find it helpful, please ⭐ star the repository to help others discover these resources! Further, some exercises require the `pruna_pro` package to address more advanced topics.
